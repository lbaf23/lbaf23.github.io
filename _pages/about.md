From 2018 to 2022, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering at the School of Software, Beihang University. I received my B.E. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2022. From 2022 to 2024, I continued my studies in Software Engineering as a masterâ€™s student at the School of Computer Science, Beihang University. In 2024, I transitioned to the doctoral program at the School of Computer Science, where I am currently pursuing my Ph.D, with Prof. Yuan Yuan as my supervisor.
